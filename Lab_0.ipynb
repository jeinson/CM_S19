    "## 0.1 Install Anaconda\n",
    "The python programming language is ubiquitous in data science, and it certaintly comes with its caveats. There are many packages available for python, and installing them so they don't fight with each other can sometimes be a challenge. In this course, all modules used for labs will be installed through Anaconda. This is a package management tool, which is very useful for dealing with these types of issues. Before coming to class, download [Anaconda 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for whatever system you use (Mac, PC, or Linux) and create an environment called `Computational_methods`, by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda create --name Computational_methods`\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to a folder where you'll save your labs (I'm calling mine `CM_S19`), and activate your new environment by running `source activate Computational_methods` (or just `activate Computational_methods` on Windows). Your terminal should now look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(Computational_methods) jonah@spectre-x360:~/CM_S19$`\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that when you run python, your computer will look for the version in the `Computational_methods` directory, and not the one that is in your global path. This can be very useful if you have programs that need different versions of python: (2.7 or 3.6 for example). To see where python is, type `which python`. Now deactivate the environment by running `source deactivate`, and locate python again. What is the difference?\n",
