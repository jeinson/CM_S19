    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab you'll learn how [Skip-Gram](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) is implemented. The skip-gram model works by training a single layer neural network to predict the surrounding words given a center word. The goal is to have a network that learns which words are more likely to appear in the context of a given word. The model is trained using word pairs given a center word, and the context words that appear within a fixed window around the word. The example below shows the word pairs created using different center words and a window size of 2\n",
    "\n",
    "![trainingWordPairs](http://mccormickml.com/assets/word2vec/training_data.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8q8PXoJwVk). So how does this model actually work? The model has two main moving parts, a set of weights representing the center word and context word embeddings or $V$ and $V^{\\prime}$. Each matrix has separate weights and $\\in R^{v, e}$ where v is the size of the vocabulary and e is the embedding dimension (a hyperparameter you choose).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model learns to minimize the following function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = log(\\sigma(v^{\\prime}_{c_o}v_{c_e}^{T})) + \\sum_{c_o,c_e \\in \\bar{D}} log(\\sigma(-v^{\\prime}_{c_o}v_{c_e}^{T}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $c_o$ and $c_e$ are the context and center words respectively, $v$ and $v^{\\prime}$ represent the center and context embeddings respectively and $\\bar{D}$ is the set of word pairs where $c_o$ are the negatively sampled context embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative Sampling\n",
    "Please refer to [this](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/) tutorial to understand more about negative sampling. You don't have to build the unigram table but you'll need to know how it's used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "There are two datasets extracted for you. One is from the ap news data, and the other is a pull from pubmed. We'll train two sets of word embeddings and compare them at the end. There is also a test corpus which you can use for debugging and getting the model to run. Extra points ($\\leq 0$) if you can [guess](www.google.com) where the corpus comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convergence\n",
    "Determining when your word embeddings are 'good enough' can be difficult. Usually people would use downstream tasks to determine if their word embeddings capture the information they're looking for. We're going to use face validity to determine if our embeddings are good enough. That is, do the closest embeddings to a given word make sense? For example you would expect the term 'union' to be closer to 'soviet' than you would 'pineapple'. You can also look at your loss function. It should decrease in small steps when your model is finished learning, but you'll still need to determine if it learned the right things **Don't stress too much about this. You just need to argue that most of the closest words make sense.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Runtime\n",
    "I would suggest starting this code early. Not only can debugging take a while, but training a single model can take 2-7 minutes per epoch depending on the number of documents and window size you use. So once the model is running let it go in the background and go read a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installs\n",
    "tqdm is a nice wrapper for loops to check your progress as you go\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "ipywidgets makes tqdm look pretty\n",
