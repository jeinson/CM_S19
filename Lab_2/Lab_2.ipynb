    "# Part 2: Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n",
    "You'll be learning more about maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) next week, but you'll have a chance to gain some intuition, and see how one can implement MLE here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section you learned how more data can help you estimate the parameters of distributions that observations are drawn from. In the example of data drawn from a normal distribution it's intuitive how we can estimate the mean and standard deviation which parameterize the distribution which generated the data. Put another way, given the data we've seen and an idea for the function which generated this data (ie a normal distribution) we want find the parameters that likely describe how this data was generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine some of the moving parts. We have some data, $X \\in R^{n}$, and we know that each observation $x^{i}$ was generated with probability defined by $f(x^{i};\\theta)$ where $\\theta$ are the parameters that help us define this function. I know this is a little handwavy but just bear with me here. You'll get a better theoretical understanding in class. Let's look at the example of the normal distribution as a data generating function. Here $f(x^{i};\\theta) = f(x^{i};\\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}exp(-\\frac{(x^{i}-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2})$ which isthe probability density function of the __[normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the probability of observing one $x^i$, but what about all $n$ of those dudes? Well since we're dealing with indpendently and identically distributed data we just multiply that function over and over to get the likelihood of observing our data. That is $f(X;\\mu, \\sigma) = \\prod_{i = 1}^{n}f(x^{i}|\\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}^{\\frac{n}{2}}exp(-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x^{i}-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so that was alot. But essentially we're just deriving the probability of seeing all our data. The next and final step is to take the log of the final equation above. We do this because of numerical stability. When you're dealing with small numbers, like fractions, repeatedly muliplying them can lead to underflow. $$L(X;\\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{-n}{2}log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x^i - \\mu)^2$$"

    "## Tensors, Variables and Computational graphs\n",
    "Insert Wizard of Oz \"Oh my\" joke here. Ok, moving on. If we're going to learn the parameters which maximize the MLE, we need to know which parameters to maximize, and how to run the MLE function as well as how to perform back propagation. Let's look at each of these pieces separately. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensors\n",
    "You can kind of think of Tensors and PyTorch's specialized NumPy matrices. How are they like NumPy matrices? They... well... they can hold values in a matrix (single or multidimensional) format. And how are the specialized? Unlike NumPy matrices Tensors can make use of GPU resources to significantly speed up matrix operations, which make up a bulk of what you need to do in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables (or Tensors with a gradient)\n",
    "It used to be that PyTorch had a separate object called a Variable which were just like Tensors, except they're meant to hold values which will change as we learn their optimal or \"true\" value. In the most current version of PyTroch these two objects have been merged into the Tensor object. When you have a Tensor which needs to store data, but also needs to be updated as we learn its optimal or \"true\" value you create a tensor but require that the gradient be stored. You'll see this in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors hold onto a few important attributes which you can access through `Tensor.grad.data` and `Tensor.data`. One holds onto the actual values of the object, while the other holds onto the gradient. As we learn more about machine learning in this class the reason why these two pieces of information are important will become clear. One important thing to know is that every time a variable is back propogated through the gradient **accumulates** and is not replaced so you have to manually zero out the gradient with `Tensorgrad.data.zero_()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational graphs\n",
    "Computational graphs are structures which store chains of multiplications, additions, and other math functions (sin, exponential, log, Hadamard product, etc) in such a way that calculating the gradient via the chain rule is simple. Again, you will learn more about why it's important for us to do this in the future, but for now all you need to know is that PyTorch creates computational graphs which allow you to easily calculate the derivative using the chain rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "A computational graph is created only once you run code which starts applying math functions, multiplications, and additions to Tensors. This means it's a dynamic computation graph. And once you calculate the derivative using a backward pass it's destroyed, meaning that all the information needed to calculate the derivatives is gone. There's more to this, but if you want to learn more about it I would suggest this __[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbJ-2G2GXL0)__ and this __[site](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-pytorch-part-1-understanding-how-automatic-differentiation-works-5008282073ec)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An example \n",
    "Let's see some of this in action. I've implemented code to learn how to maximize the MLE for data drawn from a normal distribution by learning the best $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ parameters. But let's face it, it's gonna take me a while to figure out what I'm doing. So there are 4 versions of code below. All but the last one has a bug in it that prevents it from doing what we want. **Identify the bug in each version, and what needs to be fixed**. Of course you can peak ahead to see what changed, but looking at each version by itself before moving on to the next will be helpful for future debugging sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: The third example might be kind of hard to spot because the code runs, but it never learns anything. Why might this be? What's going on with the gradient?"
